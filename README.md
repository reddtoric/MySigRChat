# SignalR Chat app
A simple real-time chat app. Created using ASP.NET Core with MVC/SignalR. This project is for learning purposes. 

I followed along a [video][1] to make a chat app; it didn't work and had many bugs. 
After spending some time debugging, making small changes and seeing what happens,
and looking at stackoverflow and Microsoft's MvcMovie tutorial project, I finally got a basic working chat app.

Topics covered: configure SignalR, SignalR Hubs, SignalR client library, send messages from any client to all connected clients

Expansion ideas: user login, grouped messages, remove/edit messages, deploy test database + app
